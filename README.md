Book Me Calendar, simple booking system



As Calendering services for small businesses are increasingly expensive and they more or less blackmail the users into lengthy subscriptions and extra services with steep pricing, this project is to fill the space where customers just get a calendering and booking system, nothing more and nothing less, without the bells and whistles, for cheaps or free.



## Synopsis
